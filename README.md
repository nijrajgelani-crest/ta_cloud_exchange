# Netskope CTE Docker Compose


## Modifying docker-compose.yml
- Replace `cte:core` with `cte:core-BUILD_TAG` where `BUILD_TAG` is the tag
generated on by the bamboo plan.
- Replace `cte:ui` with `cte:ui-BUILD_TAG` where `BUILD_TAG` is the tag
generated by the bamboo plan.

## Starting all the containers
- Run `docker-compopse up` to start all the containers.
- UI should be now accissible with VM's IP on port `3000`.

### Note: Need to initially create `cteadmin` user for the `cte` database in mongo explicitly.

## Removing previous containers
- Run `docker-compose rm` to remove previous containers.
